# About WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

This project provides a pre-configured starting point for WordPress plugin development. It is designed for developers who want a structured foundation with an integrated build process, allowing them to focus on writing plugin-specific code rather than on initial setup.

Key components include:

*   **A PHP architecture** using modern practices like namespaces, PSR-4 autoloading, and a Dependency Injection container.
*   **A Webpack 5 configuration** for handling frontend assets like JavaScript (via Babel) and Sass.
*   **Integrated linting tools** (`PHP_CodeSniffer`, `ESLint`, `Stylelint`) to maintain code quality and consistency.
*   **A set of pre-configured scripts** for common development tasks such as building assets, running a development server, and cleaning the project.

The goal is to provide a solid and maintainable base that handles the common boilerplate, accelerating the development of new WordPress plugins.
