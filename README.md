This boilerplate provides a structured starting point for plugin development, including a Webpack 5 configuration, a Dependency Injection Container, and a modular PHP architecture.

## Features

-   **PHP Foundation**: Built for PHP 8.1+, using namespaces and PSR-4 autoloading.
-   **Dependency Injection**: Includes a Dependency Injection Container for managing services and dependencies.
-   **Service Provider Architecture**: Provides a structure for organizing plugin features into modular Service Providers.
-   **Webpack 5**: A pre-configured Webpack setup for asset bundling.
    -   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: A development server with live-reloading.
    -   **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunking of vendor libraries and common modules.
    -   **Asset Minification**: Minified assets for production builds.
-   **Frontend Asset Pipeline**:
    -   **ESNext & Babel**: JavaScript transpilation for browser compatibility.
    -   **Sass**: A preprocessor for writing structured CSS.
    -   **PostCSS**: Vendor prefixing with `postcss-preset-env`.
    -   **SVG Sprites**: Automatic SVG spritemap generation.
-   **Code Quality & Linting**:
    -   **ESLint**: For enforcing JavaScript coding standards.
    -   **Stylelint**: For enforcing SCSS coding standards.
    -   **PHP_CodeSniffer**: Includes WordPress Coding Standards (`wpcs`) for PHP.

## Requirements

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

-   PHP >= 8.1
-   Node.js >= 22.0
-   Yarn (v1)
-   Composer

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/code-soup/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate.git my-awesome-plugin
    cd my-awesome-plugin
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script**:
    This script will ask for your plugin's details and configure the boilerplate files for you.
    ```bash
    # First, make the script executable
    chmod u+x setup.sh

    # Then, run the script
    sh setup.sh
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Once the setup is complete, install the necessary PHP and Node.js dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Install PHP dependencies
    composer install

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**:
    For live-reloading and automatic recompilation of assets during development.
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

## Available Scripts

This boilerplate comes with a set of pre-configured scripts for development tasks.

### PHP Scripts (via Composer)

-   **`composer lint`**: Lints all PHP files for syntax errors.
-   **`composer wpcs`**: Checks PHP files against the WordPress Coding Standards.
-   **`composer cbf`**: Automatically fixes many `phpcs` errors.

### JavaScript/Asset Scripts (via Yarn/NPM)

-   **`yarn dev`**: Starts the webpack dev server with Hot Module Replacement.
-   **`yarn build`**: Compiles and optimizes all assets for a production environment.
-   **`yarn build:dev`**: Compiles assets for development without optimization.
-   **`yarn lint`**: Runs both the script and style linters.
    -   **`yarn lint:scripts`**: Lints JavaScript files with ESLint.
    -   **`yarn lint:styles`**: Lints SCSS files with Stylelint.
-   **`yarn clean`**: Deletes the `dist` folder and the webpack cache.
